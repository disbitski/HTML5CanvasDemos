Summary:

I created these demos for the Microsoft Web Camps during December of 2011 (http://bit.ly/html5gamecamps).  I focused on HTML5 Canvas and casual gaming in particular.  The source code is included as an ASP.NET MVC Project but since this is straight HTML5/JavaScript you can run the html files directly if you choose.
